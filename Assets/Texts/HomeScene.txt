Hi.
My name is Bob.
And I live in the middle of nowhere.
You don't need to know where I live.
It's better that way.
At least that's what my wife feels. That's how I feel too.
I HAD a wife. She's probably married to someone better now. 
But I have a son. 
He's the reason why I still have a cell phone. 
Although he never picks up my call,I still keep in just in case he changes his mind.
I hope he does.
I don't understand people.
That's why I live here alone. Away from all of them. 
I do work out to keep my body fit for survival and getting just what I need.
And I still keep myself groomed because I consider myself a MAN. 

What are these noises?!
Damn it! It's so loud.

Whaa....?!

Something is definately wrong!
What are all these creatures?!
I need to call my son.

Son! Are you okay?!
