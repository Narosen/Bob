A 2D platformer PC game made in 3 days using Unity Engine. Soon to be updated...

The scripting was purely done by me.
Special thanks to opengameart.org for opensource suppliments of Music,Audio and Sprites.  

The execution file can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-1dcKLROAgSbnBrZmVHa0FHRzA)
