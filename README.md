# Bob

Bob is a 2D platformer game, on a quest to save his son.
This game was initially made as a request.
Later, it is used for for testing story scenes amd making objects interact with it according to the story.
Due to no artistic skills for making the character and tilesets, the game is only made upto level 1.
